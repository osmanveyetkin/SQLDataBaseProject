This project designs a relational database to manage Kırklareli University’s Vocational Schools (MYO), Faculties, and their respective departments.
I developed this project for my Database lesson and made the necessary adjustments before adding it here.
Key Components:
	•	Campus Table: Stores information about campuses.
	•	Vocational School Table: Links vocational schools to campuses.
	•	Department Table (MYO): Lists departments under each vocational school.
	•	Faculty Table: Represents faculties and their connection to campuses.
	•	Faculty Department Table: Lists departments under each faculty.

Features:
	•	Comprehensive relational structure connecting vocational schools and faculties to their campuses.
	•	FOREIGN KEY constraints and ON DELETE CASCADE ensure referential integrity and automatic cascading deletions.
	•	Queries (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING) provide insights into the number of departments, faculties, and vocational schools per campus.
	•	Advanced queries list and filter departments by faculty, school, and campus, including searches by department names.
	•	Expansion to support faculties and their departments enhances the project’s scalability.

This database project offers a scalable solution for managing educational institutions within the university. SQL scripts are provided to create, populate, and query the database.
